Last Updated 07/08/22: Alex Farr

## Abstract
This vault is intended to document the process of building a deployment package for Firefox: ESR, using PSADT. The content range of the vault covers the preparation steps taken and testing environment used, before moving on to cover the considerations made and the workflow behind the solution, then finally a retrospective analysis on the project. 

This vault is modeled off of my PersonalKB template both in style and structure, as such it more closely resembles my thought process and approach to solving problems for my own future reference than it does any form of materials I would write for others to reference in repeating a process.
